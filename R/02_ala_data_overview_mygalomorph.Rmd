```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load dependencies

```{r loadpackages}
# install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(galah, arrow, here, tidyverse, janitor)

```

## Read in parquet

```{r}
myg_spiders_all <- open_dataset(here("data/galah/Mygalomorphae_withassertions2023-09-01_ALA.paraquet"))
```

## Subset columns we want

```{r}
myg_spiders <- myg_spiders_all |> 
  select(decimalLatitude:collectionCode) |> 
  collect()
```

### Data Overview

How many species/genus in dataset

```{r}
myg_spiders |> 
  group_by(taxonRank) |> 
  summarise(n = n())

# how many records for each species with at least three records
myg_spp <- myg_spiders |>
  filter(!is.na(species)) |>
  group_by(species) |>
  #filter(n() > 2) |>
  tabyl(species) |>
  arrange(desc(n))
myg_spp

# Plot of records for each species
myg_spp_df <- as.data.frame(myg_spp)
barplot(myg_spp_df$n, xlab = "species", ylab = "records")

# How many species have at least three records
nrow(myg_spp)


# Why are these unranked? Selenocosmia crassipes AB to ask colleagues and JM 
myg_spiders |> 
  filter(taxonRank == "unranked") |> 
  select(scientificName, collectionCode) |> 
  distinct()

```

### Species overview by state

```{r}
# number of records by state, for species with at least three overall records
myg_spp_by_state <- myg_spiders |>
  filter(!is.na(species)) |>
  group_by(species) |>
  filter(n() > 2) |>
  group_by(stateProvince, species) |>
  summarise(n()) 
myg_spp_by_state

# number of species by state, for species with at least three overall records
myg_spp_by_state |> 
  tabyl(stateProvince) |>
  arrange(desc(n))

# number of species recorded in only one state (species with at least three overall records)
myg_spp_by_state |> 
  tabyl(species) |>
  filter(n == 1) |>
  nrow()

# number of species recorded in more than one state (species with at least three overall records)
myg_spp_by_state |> 
  tabyl(species) |>
  filter(n > 1) |>
  nrow()

```
#next steps
investigate NA states
Orders represented by how many species - barplot
investigate some of the other variables, e.g. basis of record
