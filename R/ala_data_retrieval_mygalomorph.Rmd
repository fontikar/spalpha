## Accessing data from ALA

This document lays out the workflow of getting data for Mygalomorph spiders from the ALA database 

```{r loadpackages}
install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(galah, arrow)
```

## Step 1

<!-- Ashley can you lay out the code in the chunks and describe what you are doing as text. Where possible include comments -->

```{r}

```

## Step X

<!-- Can you time stamp the download so we know when the data was accessed? -->

Save the downloaded data as a `.parquet`

```{r}
write_parquet(XX, "data/galah/")
```
